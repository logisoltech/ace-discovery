        <em>The Mobile Data Deluge: How to Tackle it for eDiscovery</em>—a rapid tour of
        acquisition tactics, decryption realities, and storytelling discipline when
        terabytes of chat history spill across inconsistent exports.
      </p>

      <SectionHeading>From SMS to Snapchat — the data never stops</SectionHeading>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-white/95 sm:text-lg">
        Jacobs reminded the room that nearly every stakeholder lives inside ephemeral
        messengers and siloed apps. Legal teams inherit unwieldy chat threads that must
        survive authentication fights—volume is only half the battle; consistency and
        narrative glue determine admissibility.
      </p>

      <SectionHeading>Collect smarter, not harder</SectionHeading>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-white/95 sm:text-lg">
        Fried pressed counsel to articulate the hypothesis before imaging an entire
        256 GB device “just in case.” Clark cautioned that dumping irrelevant noise into
        review environments pollutes AI outputs and inflates proportional fights no
        judge forgets.
      </p>

      <SectionHeading>Encrypted &amp; deleted — the new normal</SectionHeading>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-white/95 sm:text-lg">
        Deleted does not mean destroyed; encryption refresh cycles and OS updates
        rewrite the battlefield monthly. Seggebruch described a relentless cat-and-mouse
        cadence between OEM releases and forensic engineers reverse-engineering defensible
        extractions under oath.
      </p>

      <SectionHeading>Cross-app conversations — a braided headache</SectionHeading>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-white/95 sm:text-lg">
        Threads jump from email to Teams to WhatsApp without tidy boundaries. Clark
        outlined how CloudNine stitching aligns disparate repositories chronologically so
        reviewers read dialogue threads—not jagged fragments that hide intent.
      </p>

      <SectionHeading>Defensible, always</SectionHeading>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-white/95 sm:text-lg">
        Jacobs underscored the golden rule: narrate each acquisition, decryption, and
        hand-off as if a career depends on it—because eventually opposing experts will
        ask uncomfortable questions on a transcript record.
      </p>

      <SectionHeading>It&apos;s not just data — it&apos;s people</SectionHeading>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-white/95 sm:text-lg">
        Fried closed emotional loops with reminders that mobile artifacts chronicle
        human trauma, joy, negligence, and courage. Phones are diaries; treat their
        inhabitants with proportionality and empathy, not voyeurism.
      </p>

      <SectionHeading>Looking ahead</SectionHeading>
      <p className="mb-6 text-base leading-relaxed text-white/95 sm:text-lg">
        Seggebruch highlighted compressed on-scene windows—investigators may enjoy only
        an hour with a handset before travel logistics intervene. Precision beats panic.

          Cross-platform narratives require stitching—not siloed review panes alone.
