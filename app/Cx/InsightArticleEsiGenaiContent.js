        , this session walks through what&apos;s actually happening in
        discovery—today—in Oklahoma federal and state courts, and what every
        litigator should be prepared to explain.
      </p>

      <SectionHeading>The Rules Are Clear. The Risks Are Real.</SectionHeading>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-white/95 sm:text-lg">
        The federal framework is familiar to most practitioners: Federal Rules
        of Civil Procedure Rule 26 on scope and proportionality, Rule 34 on the
        form of production, and Rule 37(e) on spoliation and sanctions. When ESI
        is lost, courts focus on whether &quot;reasonable steps&quot; were taken
        to preserve it—and whether prejudice and bad faith justify relief.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-white/95 sm:text-lg">
        Oklahoma practice brings its own contours through the state court
        Discovery Code (12 O.S. Sections 3224 through 3237). State judges may
        apply broader discretion in some sanction scenarios than their federal
        counterparts, which makes local fluency essential when cases straddle
        both systems.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-white/95 sm:text-lg">
        The practical takeaways are consistent: litigation holds must start
        early, preservation should be documented, and meet-and-confers should
        address ESI intentionally—not as an afterthought.
      </p>

      <SectionHeading>
        Emerging Data Sources Are Changing Everything
      </SectionHeading>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-white/95 sm:text-lg">
        Discovery is no longer an email-only exercise. Teams must account for:
      </p>
      <ul className="mb-4 list-disc space-y-2 pl-6 text-base leading-relaxed text-white/95 sm:text-lg">
        <li>Collaboration tools like Slack and Teams</li>
        <li>Ephemeral messaging</li>
        <li>Cloud-based systems</li>
        <li>Mobile device data</li>
        <li>AI-generated documents</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-white/95 sm:text-lg">
        The panel examines strategic approaches to these sources, ESI
        protocols, and federal district guidelines—with attention to Oklahoma
        practice.

        Ethics and Technology: They&apos;re Now Linked
      </SectionHeading>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base font-semibold text-white sm:text-lg">
        Competence includes technology. Period.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-white/95 sm:text-lg">
        ABA Model Rule 1.1 Comment 8 and Oklahoma&apos;s parallel duty make the
        point explicit: attorneys must understand the benefits and risks of
        relevant technology. That includes AI tools, metadata implications for
        production, supervising technology-assisted review, and safeguarding
        client confidentiality.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 mt-10 text-base leading-relaxed text-white/95 sm:text-lg">
        It does not mean becoming a technologist. It does mean exercising
        informed judgment.
      </p>

      <SectionHeading>GenAI Is Here, Now What?</SectionHeading>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-white/95 sm:text-lg">
        Generative AI is already influencing legal workflows. Attorneys are using
        it for:
      </p>
      <ul className="mb-4 list-disc space-y-2 pl-6 text-base leading-relaxed text-white/95 sm:text-lg">
        <li>Early case assessment</li>
        <li>Relevance and privilege review</li>
        <li>Drafting and research</li>
        <li>Privilege log generation</li>
        <li>Litigation strategy development</li>
        <li>Internal knowledge management</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-white/95 sm:text-lg">
        But best practices matter.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-white/95 sm:text-lg">
        Maintain technological competence. Protect confidentiality. Verify
        everything. Use secure tools. And remember: AI augments legal
        reasoning—it does not replace it. Strategic use adds value. Overreliance
        creates risk.
