        The holiday marathon stretches from heartfelt Thanksgiving gatherings to the
        digital stampede that is Cyber Monday—which means carts fill, timelines
        tighten, and inboxes brim with urgent tasks. Across the broader economy,
        people trade sleep for bargains. Across our corner of legal operations, we mark
        a different calendar countdown:{" "}
        <strong className="text-white">eDiscovery Day</strong>, arriving{" "}
        <strong className="text-white">December 4, 2025</strong>.

        While influencers chase lightning deals and flash sales, AC Discovery stays
        fixated on the quieter wins—precision ingestion, repeatable staging, QA that
        actually improves outcomes, storytelling metrics every stakeholder trusts, and
        data strategies calibrated to courtroom obligations instead of gimmicks that
        age out before motions hit the docket.

      <p className="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-white/95 sm:text-lg">
        eDiscovery Day is our industry&apos;s unofficial field day: spotlighting the art
        of turning unwieldy digital estates into timelines that partners can pitch,
        auditors can scrutinize without drama, and clients can reconcile against real
        risk budgets—not fantasy dashboards.

        Law firms under relentless matter volume and corporations protecting brand
        reputation share the challenge: productions now stretch continents, modalities,
        ephemeral channels, regulated industries, overlapping privilege families, plus
        model-assisted coding under evolving judge expectations—so celebration is also
        an accountability exercise.

        The festivities double as forums for collaboration: comparing war stories on QC
        design, hashing out proportional collections, benchmarking AI guardrails peers
        are stress-testing—and previewing pragmatic upgrades to legal information
        management rather than vaporous promises.
