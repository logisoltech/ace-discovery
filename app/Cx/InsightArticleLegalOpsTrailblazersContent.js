        Legal operations now steers enterprise adaptation at speed. A Masters New York
        roundtable stacked with trailblazers—
        <strong className="text-white">Jeanine Conley</strong> (
        <strong>Littler</strong>), <strong className="text-white">Justina Rivera</strong>{" "}
        (
        <strong>NY Office of the Comptroller</strong>),{" "}
        <strong className="text-white">Billie Moliere</strong> (
        <strong>Robert Half</strong>), and{" "}
        <strong className="text-white">Taa Grays</strong> (
        <strong>NY State Bar Association</strong>)—examined how AI, automation, culture,
        and governance harmonize when rhetoric meets budget season.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-white/95 sm:text-lg">
        Core tension: tooling should magnify judgment, not bypass training investment.
        Veteran operators warned against outsourcing foundational skills simply because
        copilots draft faster—junior fluency still underpins QC regimes partners trust.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-white/95 sm:text-lg">
        Talent pipelines need choreography between institutional wisdom and digitally
        native hires. Structured mentoring, psychological safety, and transparent
        promotion criteria help bridge expectation splits instead of letting them calcify
        into attrition tragedies.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-white/95 sm:text-lg">
        Ethics and governance surfaced as pre-launch requirements—not post-mortems.
        Documented model risk assessments, fairness retrospectives, and stakeholder
        education build goodwill before regulators or clients interrogate slipshod pilots.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6 text-base leading-relaxed text-white/95 sm:text-lg">
        Adoption mantras rejected shiny-object hopping absent business requirements:
        frame problem statements, quantify ROI hypotheses, align budgets with executive
        sponsors, then iterate deliberately instead of stacking overlapping AI toys.
