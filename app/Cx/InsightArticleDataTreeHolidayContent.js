        While playlists pivot to peppermint lattes and twinkling lights, the pace
        of serious litigation refuses to RSVP for downtime. Custodians email at
        odd hours. Productions land with last-minute tweaks. PSTs swell. Export
        jobs queue like sleigh bells you cannot mute. Someone still has to marshal
        the metadata, tame the spreadsheets, and keep privilege calls defensible.
        Enter the quieter holiday miracle: Right Discovery teammates who steady the
        wire long after courthouse doors lock.

        The legal marketplace rarely pauses for cocoa breaks. Custody disputes,
        sprawling investigations, and board-driven investigations collide with
        fiscal-year closes—and{" "}

        Call them the engineers with the velvet sack of adapters. Whether the
        collection is bedside in a SOC2 room or surgically staged over VPN, chain of
        custody stays pristine, handoffs arrive encrypted and logged, narrative
        deliverables preempt tomorrow&apos;s meet-and-confers—no coal in your

        privilege families, escalating issue tags, and CAL/TAR/GenAI-guided sweeps,
        anchored by escalation paths that privilege partners trust when regulators
        read every footnote beneath the tinsel-strewn footnotes anyway.
