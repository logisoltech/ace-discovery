        Preserving electronically stored information (ESI) anchors any serious
        eDiscovery strategy. Once litigation is reasonably anticipated, organizations
        must keep relevant data from being deleted, altered, or lost. That{" "}

        A legal hold—litigation hold—is the customary vehicle: written direction that
        employees and custodians retain potentially responsive information. The clock
        starts when dispute is <em>reasonably foreseeable</em>, not when the complaint
        drops—{" "}

        Build a defensible narrative: when the hold launched, whom it reached,
